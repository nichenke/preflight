# Preflight — spec-kit preset + extension

Preflight is a [spec-kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit) preset and extension for spec-driven development. It ships curated doc-type templates, a 48-rule review rule set, and a two-agent review ensemble (checklist + bogey) that hooks into spec-kit's `after_specify` / `after_plan` stages.

Preflight was previously distributed as a Claude Code plugin (v0.6.x). See `git log` for the conversion from plugin to spec-kit extension (Topology A, 2026-04-14).

## Before modifying behavior

- Any behavioral change requires a version bump in `presets/preflight/preset.yml` and `extensions/preflight/extension.yml` (both track the same `0.7.0.devN` counter in lock-step)
- Version strings must be **PEP 440** format — spec-kit validates via `packaging.version.Version` and rejects hyphenated pre-releases like `0.7.0-dev1` or `0.7.0-spike` (see commit `a923e0e`). Tick the dev counter within an ongoing cycle (`0.7.0.dev0` → `0.7.0.dev1` → ...); bump the minor version only after `0.7.0` final ships
- Any behavioral requirement change requires an ADR (CONST-PROC-02)
- `.specify/memory/constitution.md` (formerly `specs/constitution.md`, moved 2026-04-15 per ADR-007 Amendment 1) is currently being rewritten — CONST-CI-02 formerly required content to live in `content/` which no longer exists; do not cite CONST-CI-02 in new work until the rewrite lands

## Dev workflow

```bash
# one-time setup
uv sync --group dev

# lint YAML manifests
uv run python -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('presets/preflight/preset.yml')); yaml.safe_load(open('extensions/preflight/extension.yml'))"

# install spec-kit from git source (PyPI's specify-cli is stale)
pipx install "git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git@v0.6.2"

# install preflight preset + extension into a target project (dev mode, points at the manifest subdirs)
cd /path/to/target-project
specify preset add --dev /path/to/preflight/presets/preflight
specify extension add --dev /path/to/preflight/extensions/preflight
```

`--dev` does a one-shot copy from the source paths — re-run both commands after edits to propagate changes into the target project.

## Content source of truth

Templates, rules, agent prompts, and scaffolds live **inside** `presets/preflight/` and `extensions/preflight/`. Edit them there. There is no separate `content/` dir — the plugin-era layout was retired during conversion.

## Spike status

Preflight is currently in Phase 1 of the ADR-007 validation spike (Topology A — preflight as a spec-kit extension). See `docs/spikes/SPIKE_PLAN.md` for phase status and open questions. Until the spike promotes ADR-007, the layout should be considered provisional.
